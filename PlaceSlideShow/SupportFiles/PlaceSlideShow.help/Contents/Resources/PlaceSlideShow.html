		<h1>Getting Started</h1>
		<p>
			The first thing PlaceSlideShow wants from you when you open it is the folder where it can find the PNG files it is meant to present.  Once you choose that, it will present the first image from the folder along with two sliders, a Start Slideshow button, and some image information along the right hand side of the window.
		</p>
		<p>
			Moving the larger slider will update which image is shown in the viewer along with the currently shown frame number along the right hand side of the window.
		</p>
		<p>
			Start Slideshow will let you start and stop the slideshow.  The slider next to it will let you change the frames shown per second.  For reference, movies in a theater will play at 24 frames per second, most moder console games play between 30 and 60 frames per second.  The slider for the slideshow can go from -200 frames per second (backwards) and 200 frames per second.
		</p>
		<p>
			Resizing the window, scrolling over the image, or zooming into the image will update the info on the right hand side of the window to represent the visible area of the image in the viewer at any point in time.
